Project is divided in two folders:
- **backend**: server logic;
- **frontend**: react app.


**Both backend and fronted need a .env file.**
- .env of backend needs to contain the key to the database;
- .env of frontend contains the url for api operations.


## Run the server

```bash
cd backend
```
- run the command to start the server locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

- should display a message in the terminal if connection is successfull.
