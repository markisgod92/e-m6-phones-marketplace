## Installation

Project is divided in two folders:
- **backend**: server logic;
- **frontend**: react app.

### Run the server

- in the ```/backend``` directory, create a ```.env``` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
```

- open terminal and move to backend directory
```bash
cd backend
```
- install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

- run the command to start the server locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

- should display a message in the terminal if connection is successfull.

### Run the app

- in the ```/frontend```directory, create a ```.env``` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=<your-localhost-url-for-backend>
```

- open a **new** terminal and move to the frontend directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

- install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

- run the command to start the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

- the app should now start on ```http://localhost:5173```
